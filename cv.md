## About me

Hello! My name is Iulia, and I work in an IT company as a manual tester. In the course of my work, I became interested in frontend development and aim to change my career path. I possess strong soft skills such as planning, prioritization, design thinking, business and technical analysis, task management using the SMART method, and teamwork.

I am drawn to continuous learning opportunities and easily absorb new knowledge. I am motivated to learn, strive to find unconventional solutions, and constantly expand my skill set. Additionally, I am focused on effective teamwork and ready to actively contribute to the success of projects.

In my current role as a manual tester, I have honed my analytical skills and attention to detail, which I believe will be valuable assets when transitioning to development. I am inspired by the prospect of learning new technologies and collaborating with a team to create innovative solutions.
